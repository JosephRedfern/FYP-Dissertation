This final year project report details the aproach taken while developing a system designed to convert video data into sensible, ``human-readable'' sound data.

The report details several key components of such a system, including image acquisition, region segmentation and extraction, shape feature extraction, and shape feature sonification.

It is anticipated that this investigatory project will serve as the basis of a broader system.
