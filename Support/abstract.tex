\begin{abstract}
    This final year project report details possible methods of sonfifying video and depth data, with the view to allowing a blind person to navigate a room without any additional assistance.

    The report also details and critically evaluates existing solutions to the problem of video to audio conversion, noting their shortcomings and pointing out areas in which they are successful. 

    By means of an experimental approach, several prototype systems are explained and discussed. Relevant theory has been explained where deemed necessary --- including concepts relating to image segmentation, descriptor extraction, shape classification and tone generation.
