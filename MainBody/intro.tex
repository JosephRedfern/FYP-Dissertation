\ac{WHO} figures claim that as as of 2012, there are 285 million people suffering from visual imparements~\cite{whoblindness}, 30 million of whom are blind. The \ac{WHO} also state that 90\% of the visually impared live in developing countries. Combined with statistics from the guide dogs for the blind association, who claim that the life-time cost of training and keeping a guide dog is around Â£50,000, a sad picture is painted the majority who are unable to afford visual aids.

\section{Aims and Goals}
This project aims to research and develop a methods of conveying visual information without the user of the system requiring a functional visual system. The study investigates both navigational and semantic modes of operation, and the different techniques associated with each implementation.

The goal of the project is to provide a functional system, able to be used to effectivley navigate around a room and avoid obstacles without the use of eyes.  

\section{Intended Audience}
The main intended audience for this project is the visually impared. It is anticipated that the "tech savvy" visually impared would be interested in trialling the prototypes, both for day-to-day use, and to assist in further development.

The system does not (initially) intend to replace all other forms of visual assistance - rather, it intends to assist those who are unable to afford luxuries such as Guide-dogs or Guide-horses~\cite{guidehorse}. A low-cost system that is capable of assisting a user in navigating a room and detecting obsticles has the potential to be life changing - even if only a small fraction of a normal, functional visual system can be imitated, 0.01\% is infinitley greater than 0.00\%.

\section{Project Scope}
The project has a fairly broad scope, and includes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Image Segmentation \hfill \\
    This deals with the extracting the input image, and extracting an object of interest
    \item Descriptor Extraction \hfill \\
    This is the extraction of descriptors from the object of interest (obtained from step 1)
    \item Descriptor Sonification \hfill \\
    Sonification of the output from step 2.
\end{enumerate}

Components/considerations \textbf{outside} of the scope of this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ethical Considerations \hfill \\
    Medical Trials/patient interviews are currently outside of scope of the project, and could be considered at a later date.
    \item Robust Testing \hfill \\
\end{enumerate}
